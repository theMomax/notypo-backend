## Getting Started

Just git-clone the repository.

```
git clone https://github.com/theMomax/notypo-backend.git
```

Use the `make` command for initial setup and to test or build the program. Type `make help`, it will print some useful information.

## API-Specification

Use the `make docs` command to show the api-specification. You need [go-swagger](https://github.com/go-swagger/go-swagger) for this command to work.
